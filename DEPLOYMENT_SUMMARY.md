## üöÄ Next Steps for Deployment

### Phase 1: Frontend Deployment (cPanel)

1. **Upload Files**
   - Connect to your GoDaddy cPanel File Manager or use FTP
   - Navigate to your website's root directory (usually `public_html`)
   - Upload all contents from `frontend/dist/`:
     - `index.html`
     - `assets/` folder and all its contents

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In cPanel, go to "Software" > "MultiPHP INI Editor"
   - Select your domain
   - Add these environment variables:
     ```
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
     ```

### Phase 2: Backend Deployment (VPS)

1. **Upload Backend Files**
   - Connect to your VPS via SSH: `ssh username@your-vps-ip`
   - Create directory: `mkdir /var/www/yvi-soft-api`
   - Upload files from `yvi-soft-backend-deploy/` to this directory

2. **Install and Configure Backend**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to backend directory
   cd /var/www/yvi-soft-api
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install PM2 globally
   npm install -g pm2
   
   # Create environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual credentials
   
   # Start server with PM2
   pm2 start server.js --name "yvi-soft-api"
   
   # Set PM2 to start on boot
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

3. **Configure Reverse Proxy**
   - Set up Apache or Nginx to proxy `api.yourdomain.com` to `localhost:3001`

4. **Configure SSL**
   - Enable AutoSSL in cPanel for both your main domain and API subdomain

### Phase 3: Testing and Verification

1. **Frontend Testing**
   - Visit your domain in a browser
   - Verify all pages load correctly
   - Check navigation and interactive elements

2. **Backend Testing**
   - Test API endpoint: `curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/api/send-email`
   - Check PM2 status: `pm2 list`
   - View logs: `pm2 logs yvi-soft-api`

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Submit the contact form
   - Verify data is saved to Supabase
   - Check that emails are received

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Commands

You can use these automated commands from the project root:

```bash
# Build frontend only
npm run build:frontend

# Prepare backend deployment package only
npm run deploy:backend

# Build frontend and prepare backend deployment package
npm run deploy
```
