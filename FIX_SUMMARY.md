## How the Fix Works

1. **Frontend Contact Form**:
   - User fills out and submits the contact form
   - Form data is validated on the frontend
   - Data is saved to Supabase (this was already working)
   - Request is sent to `https://yvisoft.com/backend/api/send-email`

2. **Apache Routing**:
   - .htaccess file routes `/backend/api/send-email` to `/backend/send-email.php`

3. **PHP Email Handler**:
   - Receives JSON data from frontend
   - Validates required fields (from, subject)
   - Generates HTML email content
   - Sends email using PHP's mail() function
   - Returns JSON response with success/failure status

4. **Frontend Response Handling**:
   - Receives JSON response from PHP handler
   - Updates UI with success/error messages
   - Clears form on successful submission

## Deployment Steps

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Upload the following to your GoDaddy hosting:
   - Contents of `frontend/dist` folder (including the new .htaccess file)
   - `backend/send-email.php` file

3. Test the contact form:
   - Fill out form with test data
   - Submit form
   - Verify data appears in Supabase
   - Verify email is received
   - Verify success message is displayed

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **No Node.js Required**: Uses PHP which is well-supported on GoDaddy shared hosting
2. **Maintains Existing Functionality**: Keeps all existing Supabase integration
3. **Proper Error Handling**: JSON responses and error handling maintained
4. **CORS Support**: Proper headers for cross-origin requests
5. **Easy Deployment**: Simple file upload process
6. **Backward Compatible**: No changes needed to existing frontend code logic

This solution resolves the CORS errors, JSON parsing issues, and email sending problems you were experiencing.
